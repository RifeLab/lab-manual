### Reading list
A [running reading list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XR6Pz5SpKKddvwUJxxzBlTmjp0qW92YvR0hIeZd9rwI/edit#gid=0) with links, keywords, authors, titles, and full citations is available via the lab Google Drive.
In addition to this list, each lab member is expected to read papers relevant to their specific topic of study and to be familiar with core topics and ideas in the field of plant breeding and genetics.
