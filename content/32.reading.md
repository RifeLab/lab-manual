## Reading {.page_break_before}

Existing literature provides the foundational knowledge and theoretical framework necessary for our current work and can be used to identify gaps in what has been done previously or inspire new research questions.
Keeping up with published literature, allows us to build on the past without unnecessary repetition and continue to move the field forward.
Papers can also be a great source of protocols, code, and data that can be used to design experiments and frame analyses.
They may also cite other relevant work that you can find and read to help further understand concepts.

### Obtaining Papers
Manuscripts may be hidden behind a paywall, but don't let this stop you from reading them.
[Clemson University libraries](https://pascal-clemson.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01PASCAL_CLEM:CLEMSON&lang=en) subscribe to many scientific journals and are often able to obtain specific articles outside of those subscriptions through Inter-Library Loan services. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net) often have alternative links to get the full text of an article or authors may have manually uploaded their full text. If all else fails, corresponding authors are nearly always willing to send a copy of their articles when direcly asked.

### Organizing files
Before you start reading, obtain a PDF reader and citation management software.
Organizing your papers as you find and read them will make it substantially easier to find them later when you need to use them as references.
Clemson provides [Adobe Acrobat](https://ccit.clemson.edu/support/current-students/software-and-applications/adobe/) for free to students, staff, and faculty.
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is a free, open-source citation manager and PDF reader that is useful for organizing, annotating, and citing papers.

### Reading a paper
When you're organized and ready to read, start with the abstract, which provides a summary of what was done and the results and conclusions from the work.
From here, your reading strategy may change depending on your goals. Typically, the figures are a good place to start.
