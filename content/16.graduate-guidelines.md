## Graduate Student Guidelines {.page_break_before}

### Academic expectations
Graduate students in the lab will:

* Maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher
* Let Trevor know when coursework needs to take priority over research
* Adhere to the highest standards of academic honesty

In turn, Trevor will:

* Adjust expectations of time devoted to research based on the amount of academic work a lab member has at a given time
* Provide guidance to lab members in strategically choosing coursework to meet long term educational goals

### Course requirements
PES does not have a required course list, however, your individual advisory committee may require specific courses for you.
Keep in mind that Graduate assistants are limited to 12 credits per semester.
The following requirements must be met through your planned course of study:

*Masters:*

* Minimum of 30 credits
* At least half must be from courses numbered 8000 or above

*PhD:*

* Minimum of 30 credits beyond a masters and 60 credits beyond a bachelors (total)
* Minimum 12 credit hours of non-thesis coursework
* Minimum 18 hours of dissertation research

### Graduate advisory committee
Every graduate student is required to have a graduate committee made up of graduate faculty members, with at least half being from PES.
Masters students must have a minimum of three faculty members on their committee and the committee must be formed no later than the middle of their second semester.
PhD students are required to have a mimimum of four members, and their committee must be formed by the beginning of the fourth semester of their doctoral program.

#### Committee meetings
Graduate students will interact with their advisory committees regularly.
Students should consult the graduate student handbook and/or correspond with the coordinator for their graduate program ([Guido Schnabel](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/faculty_staff/profiles/schnabe)) to understand the expectations that exist around communication with committee members.
Questions around what document(s) their committee will expect to see and when they should be sent to the committee should be resolved with the committee at least a month in advance of a scheduled meeting.
Students in the Rife Lab are not to provide food or drinks for committee members.

### Comprehensive examination
The comprehensive exam is designed to evaluate your overall mastery of a body of knowledge and skills after completing most of the program of study.
Satisfactory completion of the comprehensive examination must occur at least six months before graduation.
The advisory committee meets with the student and sets the details and rules for the examination.
Written examinations should be evaluated and returned to the student with appropriate comments before the oral examination.
The oral examination will include questions covering areas where weakness was demonstrated on the written examinations.
Oral exams typically last 2 to 3 hours.

### Graduate student associations
Both the PES department and the PDREC have active graduate student associations.
All graduate students are strongly encouraged to participate in these groups.

### PDREC graduate student housing
If you are interested in staying in the graduate student housing at the PDREC, please contact both [Mandy Stephan](mailto:stepha2@CLEMSON.EDU) and Trevor.
