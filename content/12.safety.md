## Safety {.page_break_before}

Your health and safety are more important than your research and require adhering to lab safety codes.
Never work in the lab if you are feeling sick, under medication that might affect your ability to work normally, or are under the effects of any kind of drug.
Avoid working in the lab by yourself doing potentially dangerous activities, and please be aware of Clemson resources and training on lab safety.

All lab members are expected to comply with University, REC, and lab safety protocols.
All lab members are must undergo mandatory comprehensive safety training for lab and pesticide safety.
Lab safety and other trainings will be presented online via TigerTraining or Bioraft/Scishield.
Contact [Sara Pederson](mailto:speders@clemson.edu) to schedule your pesticide safety training.
Information specific to the Pee Dee REC can be found on the [REC website](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/research/peedee/safety_compliance.html)

### Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
SDS are an excellent source of information on the health and physical hazards of chemicals.
SDS should always be reviewed before using a new chemical.
Our SDSs are located in (todo).
When a new chemical is purchased, the ordering party is responsible for adding the SDS into our collection.

### Gloves
*Do not touch door handles, elevator buttons, OR PHONES with gloved hands!*
* Gloves should not be worn outside of the lab.
* Wash hands every time gloves are removed.
* Wash hands before leaving the lab for any reason.
* Gloves should not be worn while using a cell phone.
* Disposable lab gloves should not be reused once they are removed.
* Remove gloves in lab when not needed for handling chemicals to minimize the potential for contamination of lab surfaces.
* Gloves that have contact involving acutely/highly toxic chemicals or [P-listed chemicals](https://www.epa.gov/hw/defining-hazardous-waste-listed-characteristic-and-mixed-radiological-wastes#PandU) should be disposed of as hazardous waste. Carefully remove these gloves, avoiding contact with skin. Wash hands with soap and water before putting on new gloves.

### Lab Attire
New lab members may request a lab coat if necessary for your research.
When performing experiments, members should wear closed toe shoes, long pants, and should tie back long hair.

### Injuries and Accidents
In case of injury, it is an employeeâ€™s responsibility to notify his/her supervisor or department head immediately.
Any injury, no matter how slight, must be reported to Trevor.
Follow the [injury or accident reporting procedures](https://www.clemson.edu/administration/risk/workers-comp/).
There are [separate forms](https://media.clemson.edu/research/safety/DSCs/Incident_Report_Form.pdf) that must be filled out depending on whether or not medical treatment was required.

### Emergencies
Hurricane season is June 1 - November 30.
In the event of a tropical storm or hurricane, please follow [state](https://www.scemd.org/stay-informed/publications/hurricane-guide), university, and PDREC guidelines.

Loss of power is common at PDREC during storms.
There is a generator for the building, but it occasionally fails.
In the event of power loss while you're workign in the lab, unplug hot plates or other equipment and store in-progress samples if possible and safe. **Do not open any fridges or freezers if the power is off.**
