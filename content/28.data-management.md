## Data Management {.page_break_before}

Data management is the process of collecting, storing, organizing, and maintaining data in a structured and systematic manner to ensure its availability, accuracy, and usability.
The Rife Lab strives to organize and store data efficiently and effectively to maximize utility.
Members of the Rife Lab involved in data collected should implement principles of the Data Lifecycle.

#### Plan
A Data Management Plan is a formal document outlining how data will be handled during and after research.
It is often required for grant proposals, and is helpful to consider when starting a project to ensure you have the ability to manage all data types that will be collected.
A good DMP will include considerations for data types, collection methods, data formats, how the data will be used, how the data will be shared, and expected data volume.

#### Collect
Collection method directly impacts impacts the data format, accuracy, and collection throughput.
Data should be machine readible to simplify analysis including using flat files with plain text, descriptive headers, limited spaces and special characters, and consistent data types.
Capturing metadata facilitates reuse and provenance and helps make the data meaningful.

#### Process
A copy of raw data should always be maintained in an unmodified state.
All changes to a dataset via scripting should be recorded via version control (Git).
Modified data files should be saved under a new name (don't overwrite the original).
Outlier removal should be standardized, reproducible, and statistically justified.

#### Analysis
Your analysis should be entirely reproducible by independent scientists outside of the lab.
A consistent scripting language should be coupled with comprehensive documentation (e.g., code comments, a repo readme, software versions used, etc.).
Reproducibility increases transparency and credibility and helps you remember what you did when it comes time to write and publish your projects.
R markdown, Quarto, and Jupyter Notebook are all great tools to help make your analysis documentation easier. 
They allow for a mix of text and code and output nice PDF or HTML documents.

#### Preservation
Data is often irreplaceable and efforts should be made to ensure it doesn't become inaccessible or lost.
Raw data should be stored in non-proprietary, future-proof file formats when possible.
Full-time employees should regularly back up their computers on an external drive, preferably through an automated backup program.
Raw data should include a README file that includes all necessary guides and metadata necessary to understand and utilize the data.
Files should be organized using a consistent and logical directory structure.
Project management such as the R package [`workflowr`](https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/) can be used to create a backbone directory structure automatically. 
In the Rife Lab, scripts scripts and small data sets should be stored in project-specific repositories on GitHub.
Large datasets should be stored on the lab NAS server or in the lab Box directory.

### Share 
**ALWAYS CHECK WITH TREVOR BEFORE SHARING DATA!**
Open science is an approach to conducting scientific research that emphasizes transparency, accessibility, collaboration, reproducibility, and inclusivity.
The Rife lab supports open science and is committed to publishing preprints and making all data and code public upon publication.
Sharing data requires understanding who is responsible for the data and has the right to make decisions about access.
Unless told otherwise, data can be shared within the research group without explicit permission.
Prior to publication, data may be shared among collaborators giving them access, often with the understanding that they will allow the data creator to lead the publication effort.
Copyright is typically held by the creator of the data.
Licenses specify how data can be used, shared, and redistributed and can be applied to data, code, and written word.
Data should always be shared according to funding agency requirements.
It is Trevor's responsibility to make the final decision regarding data sharing.

### Reuse
The FAIR principles are a set of guidelines to help improve the **F**inability, **A**ccessibiliy, **I**nteroperability, and **R**euse of digital assets [(Wilkinson et al., 2016)](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).
As a member of the Rife Lab, you are expected to familiarize yourself with these principles via the [FAIR website](https://www.go-fair.org) and put them into practice.
