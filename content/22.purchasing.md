## Purchasing {.page_break_before}

### Procedure
Requesting items for purchase in the Rife Lab is done via GitHub.
In the `Orders` repository, create an issue following the provided template.
Account numbers can be obtained in the `lab-info` repository.
Once the order is created, assign the issue to Trevor.
Trevor will attach a receipt to the issue once the item has been ordered.
You are responsible for closing the issue once the item has been received.

### Clemson Guidelines
If an order totals under $2,500, it may be purchased via PCard
If an order is over $2,500, it must be purchased via [Buyways](https://solutions.sciquest.com/apps/Router/Login?OrgName=Clemson&tmstmp=1238434453337).
If over $10,000, multiple quotes must be obtained (unless it is a [sole source](https://www.clemson.edu/procurement/faculty-staff/solesource.html) purchase).
Clemson is only tax exempt for agriculture-related purchases. Ask [Jenifer Lind](mailto:jenifel@clemson.edu) for a agricultural tax exemption card if you will be making this type of purchase.
See the [Clemson Procurement Guidelines](http://www.clemson.edu/procurement/faculty-staff/policies/) for more information.

### PCard
PCard puchases must only be made for allowable items (*Notable expenses that are not allowable include hotels, meals, gas.*).
See the [PCard Policy](http://www.clemson.edu/procurement/faculty-staff/policies/index.html#pcardpolicy) for a full breakdown of allowable purchases.
If you use the PCard for a purchase, you are responsible for getting the receipt to Trevor.
Failure to follow PCard guidelines may result in losing PCard privileges.

### Other
Amazon is a common vendor used by the lab.
All Amazon purchases must be made by Trevor through the lab Amazon Business account.
The PCard cannot be used in non-business accounts and no personal Amazon accounts should be used for lab procurement.

### Reimbursement
Purchases made on behalf of the lab can be reimbursed through [Concur](https://www.concursolutions.com).
Reimbursement requires proper documentation including the purchase receipt.
Purchases should not be made without prior approval.
