## Introduction {.page_break_before}

### Welcome
We're happy you've decided to join the Rife Lab at Clemson University.
We’re really glad to have you as a team member and will do what we can to make your time in the lab amazing.
We hope you’ll learn a lot about plant breeding, develop new skills (coding, data analysis, writing, giving talks), make new friends, and have a great deal of fun throughout the whole process.

This manual was developed by me, Trevor Rife, to provide a structured vision for how the lab should function and to complement existing Clemson University policies (which take precedence).
When you join the lab, you’re expected to read this manual and sign a [form](todo: link) indicating that you have done so.
You’re also highly encouraged to read it while deciding if you want to join the lab in the first place.
You should always feel free to talk to Trevor for clarity about anything in the lab manual or to suggest improvements.

### Mission
The Rife lab seeks to develop, validate, and implement new tools and technologies into breeding programs around the globe.
Using these tools, we aim to better understand the genetic control of economically important traits in crops that are regionally relevant for the Southeastern United States.
Critical to this goal is training the next generation of scientists, creating a safe and inclusive space for research, and facilitating an open and collaborative environment that promotes scientific advancement.

### Guiding Principles
1. Scientists are human beings. All human beings have equal innate value and are welcomed and encouraged to be their authentic selves in our lab.
1. Lab groups are more creative, productive, and successful when people from diverse backgrounds collaborate with and learn from each other.
1. A collegial and welcoming lab environment is the ideal way to encourage research excellence, extension excellence, personal growth, professional growth, and overall productivity.
1. Developing independent problem solving skills is more important than perfect execution of process and protocol.
1. We value independence and motivation. We give our people the environment, support, and resources they need to succeed, and trust them to get the job done.
1. Continuous attention to technical excellence and quality experimental design enhances discovery and innovation.
1. Efficiency and simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--are essential.
1. We reflect regularly on how to become more effective and adjust behavior accordingly.
